# Examining the Factors Influencing Injuries in the NFL

This project uses machine learning models to predict injuries in the NFL using play-by-play data. We experimented with various classification techniques, moving to explainability of a decision trees model. This repository contains all code and data necessary for repoduction as well as the final report submitted on loop. 

## Repo Structure

- *Data* – Raw and preprocessed datasets as well as results for explainability data.
- *Code* – Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis, model training, and evaluation.
- *Literature* – All related work papers read for model comparison and understanding of the topic
- *Documentation* – Final written report and project proposal folders

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Install dependencies with:
    
    pip install -r requirements.txt
